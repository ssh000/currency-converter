# INSTALL

This is simple `Create React App` application. Run `yarn`(`npm i`) and `yarn start`(`npm run start`) in order to install dependencies and to run application; 

# FEATURES

1. Date / Currency format internationalization;
2. BEM naming convetion for the styles;
3. Redux store;
4. Simple UI;
5. Currency conversion;
6. Each 10 seconds request for new currencies conversion rates;
7. Each currency conversion creates transactions for user account;

# WHAT TO IMPROVE

1. It would be nice to add `Proptypes` or` Typescript` to describe data structures in the app more eloquently;
2. It would be nice to add `esLint`;
3. Not everything covered with tests, only crucial parts;
